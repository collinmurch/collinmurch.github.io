This is a post to test markdown rendering with static sites.
Here's some **bold** text and some *italic* text.

This is a new paragraph with a link to [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev).

This paragraph is long enough to push the code block just beyond the screen limit of an iPhone.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
