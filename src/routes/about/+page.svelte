<h1>About Me</h1>

Hey! I'm Collin, a software engineer with over a
<a href="https://github.com/collinmurch">decade of experience</a>
building everything from iOS games to full stack web apps. I currently work at
<a href="https://www.zillow.com/homeloans">Zillow Home Loans</a>
where I help design and create backend tools powering the mortgage lending process.

<br />
<br />

I'm deeply curious about service architecture, artificial intelligence, and
information security. Outside of computers, I love card games (especially Texas
Hold'em), tennis, finding new electronic music, and pretty much every water
sport under the sun.

<br />
